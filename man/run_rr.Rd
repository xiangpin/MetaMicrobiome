run_rr(var_high_low, metadavector, prefix = "Group",
  grouptype = "Case", method = "cohort.count", conf.level = 0.95,
  score = "OR.strata.score", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{var_high_low}{list or vector, the list of vectors with high/low versus the threshold}

\item{metadavector}{dataframe, metada dataframe contained the group information.}

\item{prefix}{character, the header names of the metada data frame, default is 'Group'.}

\item{grouptype}{character, the positive group names, default is "Case".}

\item{method}{characer, a character string indicating the study design on which the
tabular data has been based. Options are \code{cohort.count}, \code{cohort.time}, \code{case.control}, 
or \code{cross.sectional}, default is \code{cohort.count}. See \code{\link[epiR]{epi.2by2}} for details.}

\item{conf.level}{numeric, magnitude of the returned confidence intervals. Must be a
single number between 0 and 1. See \code{\link[epiR]{epi.2by2}} for details.}

\item{score}{character, Wald and score confidence intervals for the effect 
value for each strata, default is \code{OR.strata.score}, See \code{\link[epiR]{epi.2by2}} for details .}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{\link{epi.2by2}}.}

\description{
Computes summary measures of risk and a chi-squared test for difference 
in the observed proportions from count data presented in a 2 by 2 table
with high low vector. With multiple strata the function returns crude 
and Mantel-Haenszel adjusted measures of association and chi-squared 
tests of homogeneity(based on \code{[epiR]{epi.2by2}}.
